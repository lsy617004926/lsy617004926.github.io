Research
======
* [Research on Chinese stock market return predictability (in Chinese)](https://github.com/lsy617004926/lsy617004926.github.io/blob/master/files/Research%20on%20Chinese%20stock%20market%20return%20predictability.pdf)
  * I investigated both in-sample and out-of-sample return predictabilities in China with various economic indicators and market anomalies.
  * In-sample test showed only turnover indicator lost its predictability. For the out-of-sample predictability, most economic indicators lost their predictabilities. 
  * Used various machine learning methods to enhance forecast abilities. The best forecast method varied among sample periods, implying the instability of the model. 
  * In the full sample, the predictor average forecast produced better out-of-sample predictability against the historical average forecast consistently.

* [The Effect of Audit Failure on SEC Monitoring of Peer Firm](https://github.com/lsy617004926/lsy617004926.github.io/blob/master/files/The%20Effect%20of%20Audit%20Failure%20on%20SEC%20Monitoring%20of%20Peer%20Firm%20end%20version.pdf)
  * Examined the correlation between the SEC monitoring intensity (proxied by SEC filing request through EDGAR database) of a firm and whether the firm was audited by a “contaminated” audit office who conducted an audit failure in the same year. 
  * Showed that not only the firm’s own characteristic, but also its peers’ disclosures, had an impact on the monitoring intensity of SEC. 
  * Provided new insights about the SEC actions about target selection procedure by suggesting that SEC perceives and reacts to office-level contagion of low audit quality identified by Francis and Michas (2013).

* [Effect of trade policy uncertainty on realized volatility of commodities](https://github.com/lsy617004926/lsy617004926.github.io/blob/master/files/TPU-on-RV-version-quarterly-china-douer-ranyou.html)
  * Used vector-autoregression model (VAR) to identify the effect of trade policy uncertainties on the volatility of commodity prices.
  * Estimated generalized Impulse Response Functions in which the shocks is included in the VAR model. 
  * Used orthogonalized IRFs based on VAR ordering in VAR model instead of the generalized IRFs and estimated a new bivariate VAR model to check the robustness of the result.
