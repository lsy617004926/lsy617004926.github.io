Hi! I’m Siyang Liu, welcome to my webpage!

My background and history
======
I received my Bachelor of Economics in Finance from the University of Science and Technology of China. After graduating, I joined a proprietary division of a hedge fund to research high-frequency trading strategies. Currently, I am a Master's student in Finance at the UBC Sauder School of Business.

My study interest
======
I'm currently interested in both emperical and theory asset pricing research.



<!-- I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on Wikipedia, where I’ve studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the Open Science Grid, and the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments. I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems. -->

<!-- My background and history
======
I received my Ph.D from the UC-Berkeley School of Information, my M.A. from the Communication, Culture, and Technology program at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in the Humanities program at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the Best Practices in Data Science series. -->
